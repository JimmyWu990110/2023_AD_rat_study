

ROIs including cortex and hippocampus (label 1 and 2) were drawn manually on one of the 43 dynamics 
in the APT images (0.7uT and 1.3uT in group A) which provides clear contrast.
The ROI may be smaller than the actual cortex/hippocampus to ensure all labelled area
belong to cortex/hippocampus.
